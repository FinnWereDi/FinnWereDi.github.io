                Endless Summer Vacation is the eighth studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus, released on March 10, 2023, via Columbia Records. It is her first new body of work since leaving RCA Records after her seventh studio album Plastic Hearts (2020) and signing with Columbia in early 2021. A pop and dance-pop record, Endless Summer Vacation is a shift from the synth-pop, rock, and glam rock genres featured on Plastic Hearts. Cyrus related its overall concept to her affection for Los Angeles, where the album was mainly recorded, and its track sequencing to the course of a day. Brandi Carlile and Sia are featured as guest vocalists.

                The album was supported by three singles. The lead single, "Flowers", set several streaming and chart records and spent eight weeks atop the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, marking Cyrus's second number-one in the country, and topped the charts in 36 other countries. "River" and "Jaded" followed as subsequent singles in March and April 2023.
                Upon release, Endless Summer Vacation received positive reviews from music critics, who complimented its production, commercial appeal, and Cyrus's vocal performance. Commercially, it reached number-one in ten countries and the top 10 in 17 countries. The album has been nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the upcoming 66th Annual Grammy Awards, whilst "Flowers" received nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.
